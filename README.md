## What I’m building now

- **Restaurant Turnover — EDA → Baseline ML**  
  Notebook-first workflow with an HTML export for quick review.  
  Repo: https://github.com/APT-5A/restaurant-turnover

- **Visualization Patterns**  
  Reusable snippets for clean plots, small-multiples, and dashboard-ready HTML blocks.

- **Creative Tech Experiments**  
  Houdini dynamics + Python utilities to make simulation results easy to explain.

## Featured Projects

### 🧭 Restaurant Turnover (ML playground)
- Goal: predict turnover risk, highlight drivers, and ship a readable HTML report.
- Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, HTML export
- Repo → https://github.com/APT-5A/restaurant-turnover

### 🎛️ Notebook Visual Storytelling
- Goal: opinionated patterns for “explain-as-you-code” notebooks (analysis first, then insight).
- Stack: IPython display, HTML/CSS blocks, pandas profiling-style helpers
- Repo → (coming soon)

### 🧩 Houdini / 3D Notes
- Goal: small utilities & notes that bridge simulations and data storytelling.
- Repo → (coming soon)

## How I work (repeatable notebook rhythm)

1. **Show the step** (code) → 2. **State the takeaway** (*Observation / Insight* block)  
   This keeps analysis readable, reviewable, and presentation-friendly.

- Clear sections: *Data Intake → QC/Profiling → EDA → Baselines → Validation → Packaging*  
- Exports: `notebook.ipynb` **and** `notebook.html` (inputs + outputs)

---

## Toolbox

- **Python:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Viz/storytelling:** HTML-in-notebook blocks, lightweight dashboards
- **Ops & data:** Git, GitHub Actions (basic), CSV hygiene & reproducible runs
- **Creative:** Houdini, Blender (geometry nodes), ComfyUI

## Learning roadmap (near-term)

- Model evaluation beyond accuracy (ROC-AUC, PR curves, calibration)  
- Feature importance that doesn’t lie (permutation, SHAP)  
- Packaging analysis for stakeholders (one-click HTML/PDF)
